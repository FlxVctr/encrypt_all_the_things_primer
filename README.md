# Encrypt all the things!!!

## (Digital Privacy & Security for Researchers)

*Primer for an encryption workshop for journalists and researchers*

In this talk we address digital threats a journalist (and everyone else!) should protect against, such as weak password reuse, revealing your identity through your ip address and browser details, unencrypted communication, unencrypted devices and meta data retention. We then explain basics of computer security, the encryption of data and communication, and provide recommendations for existing tools to make your digital activity more secure.

### How to edit

Follow the full install instructions in [here](README_reveal.js.md#full-setup), but use `encrypt_all_the_things` instead of `reveal.js`.

Run `npm start` to run the presentation locally on your computer.

Except for `index.html` and this `README.md`, the presentation files are contained in the `encrypt_all_the_things_slides` subdirectory to keep them separate from the `reveal.js` files.
`index.md` contains a markdown document representing the presentation. The syntax should become clear from the document itself.

#### New slide

Only speciality is that `___` (three underscores) represents a new slide to the right, while `____` (four underscores) represents a new slide to the bottom.

#### Speaker notes

start a line with `Note:`. When presenting press `S` to view presenter window.

#### Printing

Use url: http://localhost:8000/?print-pdf#/ and print via the dialog in your web browser.

#### Previous versions of workshop

Full versions of the workshop are available on the releases page: https://github.com/qut-dmrc/encrypt_all_the_things/releases
